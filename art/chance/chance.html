            In 2019, the incidence rate of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in
            Australia for people between 20 and 39 was 0.8 per 100,000, or
            0.0008%.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between 2015 and 2019, the relative five-year ALL survival rate for
            people between 25 and 34 was 74.7%.
          </p>
          <p>
            The artwork is designed to simulate these statistics. There are
            101,761 light purple dots in the frame. A white dot indicates
            five-year survival of ALL diagnosis. If there is a loss, and one dot
            does not pass the 75% survival chance, then the remaining dots will
            be white.
          </p>
          <p>
            The statistics were sourced from the
