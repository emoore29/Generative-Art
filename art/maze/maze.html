            width. This is my first time using HTML's canvas tag and first
            introduction to generative art. I recommend reading through the
            tutorial to best understand how this works, but I'll write my own
            explanation below to try to consolidate my own understanding.

          <p>
            There is some initial code that sets up the canvas size and scale.
            I've given my canvas an id of "maze", so first we can store that in
            a variable named "canvas".
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/getContext"
              target="_blank"
              >HTMLCanvasElement.getContext()</a
            >
            returns a drawing context on the canvas. This creates a
            CanvasRenderingContext2D object representing a two-dimensional
            rendering context, provides access to a bunch of methods via the
            CanvasRenderingContext2D prototype. This includes methods such as
            moveTo(), lineTo(), and stroke(), which are used for this tutorial.
          </p>

            class="code"
            src="./canvas setup.PNG"
            alt="Code for getting the canvas context."
          />
          <p>
            To understand the above code, I think it's helpful to outline some
            technical terminology.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Logical pixels</em>: These are also referred to as CSS pixels.
              They don't have any inherent physical dimensions. On most screens,
              one logical pixel corresponds to one physical pixel; however, some
              high-density screens use multiple physical pixels to represent a
              single logical pixel.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Physical pixels</em>: These are the actual physical pixels on
              a given device. As above, one or more physical pixels might make
              up a logical pixel.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>PPI</em>: Pixels per inch measures the
              <strong>pixel density</strong> on an electronic device.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>DPR</em>: Device pixel ratio is the ratio between the
              <strong>physical pixel density</strong> of a device and its
              <strong>logical pixel density</strong>. The higher the DPR, the
              more physical pixels representing logical pixels.
            </li>

            <li>
              <em>Screen resolution</em>: This is the number of
              <strong>physical pixels</strong> in the display, typically quoted
              as width x height.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Viewport resolution</em>: This is the number of
              <strong>logical pixels</strong> in the display, typically quoted
              as width x height.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            So with the above terminology in mind, multiplying size and DPR
            gives us the actual canvas width and height in physical pixels,
            rather than the 320 logical CSS pixels.
          </p>
          <p>
            By default, one unit on a canvas is one pixel. Scaling based on DPR
            will then adjust the units based on the DPR, so one unit will be one
            physical pixel.
          </p>
          <h3>Examples</h3>
          <p>
            In the original tutorial, the size is given by the window inner
            width, but I found this results in a very different appearance of
            the maze on mobile vs desktop, so I chose to use the fixed size of
            320 to match the logical CSS pixels. If you look at their CodePen,
            they've actually done the same there.
          </p>
          <p>
            On my desktop monitor, the DPR is 1. The size is 320. So my canvas
            width and height are 320 physical pixels. One unit in the canvas
            will be one physical pixel.
          </p>
          <p>
            On my mobile, the DPR is 2.73. The size is 320. So my canvas width
            and height are approximately 874 physical pixels. One unit in the
            canvas will be 2.73 physical pixels.
          </p>
          <h3>Drawing</h3>
          <p>Finally, we can look at the code that draws the maze.</p>
          <img
            class="code"
            src="./Drawing.PNG"
            alt="Code that draws the maze on the canvas."
          />
          <p>
            The draw function takes x, y, width, and height, which are used to
            define the start and end points of the line. context.stroke() then
            draws a stroke between those two points. In the draw() function,
            there's a 50% chance that the line starts at x, y, or x + width, y,
            and the rest is pretty self-explanatory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, in a for loop, we loop through y values and run draw each
            time, incrementing y by 15 each loop. Then we loop through the x
            values. So essentially, we're drawing the strokes in columns that
            are 15 logical pixels wide from top to bottom, starting at x = 0 and
            incrementing +15 each time, up to 320. Each diagonal line is in the
            middle of a 15 x 15 square.
