            >. This is my first time using HTML's canvas tag and first
            introduction to generative art. I recommend reading through the
            tutorial to best understand how this works, but I'll write my own
            explanation below to try to consolidate my own understanding.

          <p>
            There is some initial code that sets up the canvas size and scale.
            I've given my canvas an id of "maze", so first we can store that in
            a variable named "canvas".
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/getContext"
              target="_blank"
              >HTMLCanvasElement.getContext()</a
            >
            returns a drawing context on the canvas. d" creates a
            CanvasRenderingContext2D object representing a two-dimensional
            rendering context, provides access to a bunch of methods via the
            CanvasRenderingContext2D prototype. This includes methods such as
            moveTo(), lineTo(), and stroke(), which are used for this tutorial.
          </p>
          <img
            class="code"
            src="./canvas setup.PNG"
            alt="Code for getting the canvas context."
          />
          <p>
            To understand the above code, I think it's best to outline some
            technical terminology.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Logical pixels</em>: These are also referred to as CSS pixels.
              On most screens, one logical pixel corresponds to one physical
              pixel, however, some high-density screens use multiple physical
              pixels to represent a single logical pixel.
