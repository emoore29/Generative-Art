          <p>
            For an explanation of the canvas setup, see my

          <p>
            We start with an empty array named lines, and in this array we're
            going to push a bunch of points.
          </p>

            alt="For loop that creates the lines array."
          />
          <p>
            Since our size is 320 and our step is 10, the loop runs 32 times.
            <strong>var line</strong> represents a horizontal line made up of
            points. Each point on the same line has an x value incremented by
            10, and a relatively constant y value that starts to vary when the
            line is closer to the middle of the canvas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's look at the second line from the top: i == 20. Here's the line
            array:
          </p>
          <img
            class="code"
            src="./lineexample.PNG"
            alt="Line array containing points making up one line."
          />
          <h3>Variance calculation</h3>
          <p>
            Without the variance calculation, the line would be a simple flat
            line, with x points incrementing by 10 and y == 20. Firstly, the
            distance of the point from the center of the canvas is calculated
            (e.g., x == 60, distanceToCenter == 100). Then, the multiplier is
            calculated. The further the point is from the center, the smaller
            the multiplier will be. If the calculation result is negative,
            Math.max() will choose 0 as the multiplier, and there will be no
            variation. Finally, a random value is generated that will be
            subtracted from the y value of the current point, to create the
            variation seen in the line points seen in the above array. We
            continue to loop until we've generated 31 lines.
