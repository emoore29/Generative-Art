          <p>
            For an explanation of the canvas setup, see my
            <a href="../maze/maze.html">maze explanation</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            We start with an empty array named lines, and in this array we're
            going to push a bunch of points.
          </p>
          <img
            class="code"
            src="./linepoints.PNG"
            alt="For loop that creates the lines array."
          />
          <p>
            Since our size is 320 and our step is 10, the loop runs 32 times.
            <strong>var line</strong> represents a horizontal line made up of
            points. Each point on the same line has an x value incremented by
            10, and a relatively constant y value that starts to vary when the
            line is closer to the middle of the canvas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's look at the second line from the top: i == 20. Here's the line
            array:
          </p>
          <img
            class="code"
            src="./lineexample.PNG"
            alt="Line array containing points making up one line."
          />
          <h3>Variance calculation</h3>
          <p>
            Without the variance calculation, the line would be a simple flat
            line, with x points incrementing by 10 and y == 20. Firstly, the
            distance of the point from the center of the canvas is calculated
            (e.g., x == 60, distanceToCenter == 100). Then, the multiplier is
            calculated. The further the point is from the center, the smaller
            the multiplier will be. If the calculation result is negative,
            Math.max() will choose 0 as the multiplier, and there will be no
            variation. Finally, a random value is generated that will be
            subtracted from the y value of the current point, to create the
            variation seen in the line points seen in the above array. We
            continue to loop until we've generated 31 lines.
          </p>
          <h3>Drawing the lines</h3>
          <img
            class="code"
            src="./drawinglines.PNG"
            alt="Code to draw the lines."
          />
          <p>
            Again, we use a for loop, and here we're looping through each line
            in the lines array, starting at the fifth line to leave a gap at the
            top of the canvas.
          </p>
          <p>
            context.beginPath() starts a new path for every loop. We also move
            to the first point in the next line at the start of each loop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, we create another loop, this time to loop through each point
            in the line we're currently on in the primary loop. For each point,
            we're creating a quadratic curve. quadraticCurveTo() requires the x
            and y coordinates of a control point, which determines the shape of
            the curve, and the x and y coordinates of the end point.
          </p>
          <p>
            This gets difficult to understand given that we're looping through
            so many things. Let's look at the first line we see (the 6th line in
            the lines array) Here's a screenshot of the array of all the points
            in this line. We're going to look at point 10.
          </p>
          <img src="./control points.PNG" alt="First line control points" />
          <p>
            The red dot indicates the control point, and the blue dot indicates
            a point on the line. In the image, the blue dot isn't perfectly on
            the line, and this is because as we're creating quadratic curves,
            the drawn line is curving away from the specific point listed in the
            array.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the calculation, the x control point is a point halfway between
            the current point's x value and the next consecutive point's x
            value. The y control point is a point halfway between the current
            point's y value and the next consecutive point's y value.
